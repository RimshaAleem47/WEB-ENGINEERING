        An Introduction for Today’s Digital World introduces undergraduate students to a wide variety 
        of concepts they will encounter throughout their IT studies and careers. The book covers computer
        organization and hardware, Windows and Linux operating systems, system administration duties, 
        scripting, computer networks, regular expressions, binary numbers, the Bash shell in Linux, DOS, 
        managing processes and services, and computer security. It also gives students insight on IT-related
        careers, such as network and web administration, computer forensics, web development, and software
        engineering.
        Suitable for any introductory IT course, this classroom-tested text presents many of the topics
        recommended by the ACM Special Interest Group on IT Education (SIGITE). It offers a far more detailed
        examination of the computer than current computer literacy texts, focusing on concepts essential to
        all IT professionals—from operating systems and hardware to information security and computer ethics. The book highlights Windows/DOS and Linux with numerous examples of issuing commands and controlling the operating systems. It also provides details on hardware, programming, and computer networks.
